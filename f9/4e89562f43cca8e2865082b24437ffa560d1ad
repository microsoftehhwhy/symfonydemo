About Intl js date management, moment is not recommanded anymore, but they advice to use their new Intl Date wrapper lib [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) or [Temporal](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/future/)

Thanks for this contribution. Let's see if this time we can finish and merge this üôè

I tested it locally and found some issues.

**(1)** The datepicker doesn't work for me:

And the error details:

**(2)** Some spacing and font sizes look too different. The new design doesn't have to be identical to before, but it should be closer.

See before/after comparisons:

In the above screenshot, let's tweak the top bar and the form fields to look like before, but let's keep the new bi buttons because they look better than before.

The language spotter in flatpicker.js is now fixed, just an oversight. At first I added the language as a data-attribute of the body, but I finally said to myself that it was already present in the html tag, so I had corrected too quickly...

You can now test the feature, I'll have a look for design adaptations.

These differences come from the change to Bootstrap 4 and conforms to the standard Bootstrap 4 interface standards.

Units are basically changed to rem rather than pixels.
They changed the size of the inputs, the functioning of the navbar...
They used a scaffolding script (_scaffolding.scss) which differs from the new reboot system (_reboot.scss) in many points.

I'm not sure I've mastered these concepts enough to act properly on the interface, but if someone reading this in the assembly is an UX/UI master, show up with pleasure!

This looks fantastic now! Thanks a lot Arnaud.

However, there's two minor issues related to the datepicker. Please, tell me if I'm doing something wrong:

(1) There's a design issue with the form field icon:

<img width="932" alt="datepicker-icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/231191836-5567c2b7-a2b1-4e07-bdb2-70d1676814f0.png">

(2) The datepicker works for me in all languages:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| <img width="420" alt="datepicker-es" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/231191946-b6d91697-72c4-452f-aee5-f8249bceebd3.png"> | <img width="499" alt="datepicker-fr" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/231191966-3853d09c-4215-42f9-986f-53af5ceff70b.png"> |

But in English it doesn't work ü§î
