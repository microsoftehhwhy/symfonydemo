Hi Javier, `em` is a relative unit that scales on ancestors `font-size`.

When you render an icon inside a `.btn.btm-sm` which has a `font-size: 0.875rem`, the icon will be rendered smaller (visually 14px x 14px) instead of 16px x 16px if the parent's font-size was `1rem`:

And here where the icon is inside a `.btn.btn-lg`, you can see it's visually rendered as 20px x 20px:

@Kocal yes, you are right. But even with the `1em` width/height of the icons, to me they look visibly smaller than the text that goes along them. I'll keep the `1.2em` default attribute then. Thanks!

It may also be related to the fact that previous icons (via FontAwesome) were rendered using a font, whereas now a `<svg>` element is used. ðŸ¤”
