Something related to https://github.com/symfony/demo/pull/716#issuecomment-348763017

Btw, do you have a link to that discussion @javiereguiluz ? Or is it something internal?

It was an internal discussion, so I can't link to it. Sorry.

I'm üëç on this.

Until packs unfolding feature comes this is the right thing to do IMO.

@garak Please run `composer update` and commit `composer.lock` to fix Travis.

Let's merge this! But "unpacking packs" is coming very soon to Flex: https://github.com/symfony/flex/pull/241
