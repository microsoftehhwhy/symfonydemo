Thanks for this proposal Pol ... I don't know much about this (@wouterj knows everything about the new security system) but I think this proposal makes sense (I even think that Symfony made it "mandatory" a while ago ... or maybe it was a related change, I can't remember exactly).

In any case, I like the overall idea ... and I like it even more because it solves your issue. But let's wait for more comments to see if there's some technical drawback. Thanks!

It's barely 23 hours since the last comment on this PR. There is a lot more to do in the life of open source maintainers than merging PRs in one of the 10+ packages they maintain :)
