@voronkovich thanks for this improvement. I do agree with you that this proposal is much better. You don't need to know the internal Symfony details when you are learning Symfony.

In any case, before merging it, I'll wait a bit so others can comment if they don't agree or see some drawback. Cheers!

I agree with it because it's more readable and less "frigthening" for beginners.
