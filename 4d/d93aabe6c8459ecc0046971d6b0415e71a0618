I need help to rebase this PR. Only the last two commits are part of this PR.

@javiereguiluz I mistakenly worked on this PR from a previous PR. Would like to leave just two last commit in this branch. Can you help me?

In that case I always do a `git rebase -i`, delete the wrong commits and then I do a `git push -f`

@yceruto, you can use `git cherry-pick` to copy the last commits to an appropriate branch and then `git rebase -i` to delete those commits from the current branch. https://nathanhoad.net/how-to-cherry-pick-changes-with-git

@yceruto, I think it's not necessary to define `MomentFormatConverter` as a service,  you can create it's instance inside the form's type constructor method.

I'd like to merge this super-cool date picker as soon as possible. However, I have a problem with the feature that allows you to navigate from one month to another. The feature works es intended ... but the arrows aren't displayed:
