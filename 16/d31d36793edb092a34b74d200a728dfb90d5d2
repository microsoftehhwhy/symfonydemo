Seems `--prefer-lowest` is avaliable argument for `composer up` command only.

It makes sense

Closing it as "won't fix".

@javiereguiluz my point in the comment you linked is that it does not really make sense to test against different deps versions as we are locking deps

@stof you are right. Sorry for not understanding you earlier. I've just reopened and made a lot of simplifications to the Travis config. Thanks!

Cool! It has become much easier now :+1:

@bocharsky-bw I agree! @stof's comments are always spot on. I love the new Travis config.

@javiereguiluz I also suggest enabling the Travis caching for the composer cache, so that it does not to re-download the same archives for each build (project with locked dependencies benefit from it even more than others because the deps change only when you commit a change, not when a new release of a deps is done:

```yaml
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.composer/cache/files
```

Nice! Enabled the cache too. Thanks.
