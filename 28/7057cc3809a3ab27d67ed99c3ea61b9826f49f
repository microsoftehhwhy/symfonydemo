Great PR :)
Also it could be great to add in the readme that the demo uses latest symfony version, and also upgrade the php required version mentionned
:)

@stof what do you propose to fix the bugs reported by the "Lint / Linters (8.0)" GitHub action?

* Ignore them in this PR, but fix them in a separate PR before the next stable release (the first one compatible with 6.0)
* Ignore them and release the next stable release without fixing them (fix them in the future)
* Fix them in this PR
* Tweak the PHPStan config to remove most of these "bugs"
* other?

Thanks!

Most of the errors have 2 sources:

- Symfony 6 provides more precise return types, which means that some baseline errors have disappeared entirely
- the CI now runs phpstan 1, which changed some error message (talking about `type` rather than `typehint`) meaning the baseline does not match anymore

In both cases, the fix for this PR is the same: running `phpstan analyze --generate-baseline` to regenerate the baseline and commit the new phpstan-baseline.neon file.

btw, phpstan should be installed through require-dev instead of relying on a global install in github actions, so that the second point (changes due to changing the version of phpstan) only happens when actually updating the phpstan dependency.
