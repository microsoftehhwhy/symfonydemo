I reverted the code style issue regarding flashBag vs flashbag. The shame is that I checked first in [the documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/controller.html) and the twig example use `flashbag`.

@f-plante given that PHP method names are case-insensitive, both work

Yes, I know that. That's why I called it a _code style issue_. This seems important to @xabbuh to keep the case as-is.
