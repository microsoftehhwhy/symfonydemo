Commands still extend from `ContainerAwareCommand` and get services with `$container->get()` What can we do about that? Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I'm a bit undecided about commands (what to officially recommend). In the docs, I've left the `$this->getContainer()->get()` in the commands, and just mentioned that you can use DI normally now that these are services. So, the answer would be, if you want, you can absolutely add a `__construct()` method to these commands and use normal DI.

We could use `AbstractController` instead?

I've updated commands to use DI too. Please let me know other places where we can use the new features. Thanks!

Ready for the final review before merge. Thanks!

About fixtures, the fixtures bundle should probably be updated to allow for fixtures to be a tagged service. The fact that you can't use autowiring for them is due to this shortcoming, which is with the bundle imo

After upgrading to 3.3.0 final, I see these deprecations:

I've reported the issue on https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/22951
