And you also need to enable it, I believe, currently to automatically see them (thanks to Javier for pointing this out) - `chrome://flags#view-transition-on-navigation`

(not for Turbo & Turbo 8's auto view transitions, you do not need to enable this flag - just mentioning that here for clarity - it is only the automatic view transitions that requires the flag, it seems)
