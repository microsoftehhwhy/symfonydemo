I appreciate your efforts to fix this problem ... but shouldn't we wait for a fix upstream? I don't think we should modify this file ourselves.

this must indeed be fixed in SensioDistributionBundle. Otherwise the fix would be lost on the next ``composer update`` (or even ``composer install`` btw IIRC)

@javiereguiluz Yes, you're definitely right but you misunderstand me. The `sensio/distribution-bundle` `v5.0.17` is already released. Those changes were made by Composer, not by me. Check the composer.lock suppressed diff

@bocharsky-bw thanks! I understand this PR now. I've updated the title to make it easier to understand.
