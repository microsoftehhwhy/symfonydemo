@weaverryan do the contents of manifest.json (https://github.com/symfony/demo/pull/1186/files#diff-5b25b49754eae753751b405108bfa940b5643f068e4ea9576651106d44f7cc86) look OK to you?

To me is strange to have this "font" called "app":

```
"build/app.eot": "/build/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.5be1347c.eot",
  "build/app.svg": "/build/images/glyphicons-halflings-regular.060b2710.svg",
  "build/app.ttf": "/build/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.4692b9ec.ttf",
  "build/app.woff": "/build/fonts/lato-normal.1d2ca94d.woff",
  "build/app.woff2": "/build/fonts/lato-normal.75614cfc.woff2",
```

And, is it OK to link to node_modules directly in the other fonts?

```
"build/node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts/fa-solid-900.svg": "/build/images/fa-solid-900.0454203f.svg",
  "build/node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/webfonts/fa-brands-400.svg": "/build/images/fa-brands-400.991c1c76.svg",
  ...
```

Thanks

@javiereguiluz these are entries managed by webpack to reference them in CSS files, not entries that you will reference yourselves. So their name does not really matter.

OK, thanks ... but this looks wrong:

```
  "build/app.eot": "/build/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.5be1347c.eot",
  "build/app.svg": "/build/images/glyphicons-halflings-regular.060b2710.svg",
  "build/app.ttf": "/build/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.4692b9ec.ttf",
  "build/app.woff": "/build/fonts/lato-normal.1d2ca94d.woff",
  "build/app.woff2": "/build/fonts/lato-normal.75614cfc.woff2",
```

These fonts should be exported as a font called "app". It's probably a misconfiguration on our side.

Well, for these fonts, we actually don't care about them being in the manifest: they are not configured entries in the Encore config but they are referenced in CSS. That's probably why they have weird names: their name is never configured anywhere.

We have few issues open right now related to some of the paths of images/fonts in `manifest.json`. So while this won't affect symfony-demo, I think there is some outstanding problem.
