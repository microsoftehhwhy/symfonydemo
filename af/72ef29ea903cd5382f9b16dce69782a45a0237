@llupa thanks a lot for taking the time to extract this new translation. I know this takes some time, so we truly appreciate it 🙇

In #1495 we added a Bengali translation (code `bn`). The "Keep me logged in" string should be translated as `আমাকে প্রবেশকৃত অবস্থায় রাখুন`. If you have some time for this, please add that translation too. Otherwise, I'll do it while merging. Thanks a lot!

@javiereguiluz done 👍 but I used GH UI sync button and it did it via merge, not rebase. IDK if you squash when accepting PRs or not. but I can also squash from my side.

Let me know.

Thanks a lot. Yes, the tool we use to merge things squashes everything by default. If it doesn't work in this case, I'll tell you. Thanks.

> Wikipedia only has pt and this app has pt_BR. Generally Wikipedia's login labels are different from the demo, but I cannot really tell the cultural difference of Keep me logged in

Native pt-br speaker here. Current translation is fine 👍
