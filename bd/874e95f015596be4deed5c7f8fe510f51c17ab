Any chance to get this merged before SymfonyCon begins @javiereguiluz? :)

I know nothing about Heroku ... so I cannot review or test this myself. I was waiting to receive any approval/reject comment from anyone.

Luckily you are trustworthy, so I guess I'll have to merge this blindly.

Has CI already worked on Heroku for users? I triggered an error in unit tests [here](https://github.com/bocharsky-bw/symfony-demo/blob/patch-1/tests/AppBundle/Utils/SluggerTest.php#L33), but Heroku still successfully build the app without any errors.

Should we wait until this feature will be stable and available for all Heroku users? I see you mentioned it's currently in beta.

@dzuelke is there any doc about Heroku CI anywhere ? I haven't found any

It's in private beta, @bocharsky-bw and @stof. I'm also happy to wait with this PR until it's GA, @javiereguiluz :)

This is now in public beta, so merge away, @stof or @bocharsky-bw :)
