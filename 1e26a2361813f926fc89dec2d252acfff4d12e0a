@EmanueleMinotto thanks for working in this. I'll wait a bit before merging it so people that understand this configuration can review it. Thanks.

@javiereguiluz great, thanks

I'm leaving appveyor output here for a fast access to it: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/EmanueleMinotto/symfony-demo

@javiereguiluz I suggest you to enable AppVeyor on the repo *before* merging this (configuring it to run only when there is a config file, so that it does not impact other PRs). This way, we would have the feedback in the PR status

@fabpot when you have some free time, please enable AppVeyor for this `symfony-demo` repository. Thanks!

done

@EmanueleMinotto please rebase your PR so that it triggers an AppVeyor build now that it is enabled on the repo

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by EmanueleMinotto at 2015-10-20T20:31:47Z

@javiereguiluz PR rebased, now should be ok

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@EmanueleMinotto thanks. By the way, there are some warnings in the AppVeyor output:

```
WARNING: Write-ChocolateySuccess is deprecated. If you are the maintainer,
please remove it from your package file.

...

Get-BinRoot is going to be deprecated by v1. Many packages no longer require
it since the folders no longer have versions on them.

...
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-10-21T09:16:42Z

@javiereguiluz this should be reported to the maintainers of these chocolatey packages

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof merging then. Thanks.
