I don't usually like to restrict the behaviour of the native UI elements unless there is a good reason for it. But I'll wait to read more opinions. Thanks.

@javiereguiluz I understand your point. In this case we could avoid this behavior that affects the design when creating or editing a post.

another solution is to add ``max-width: 100%``. This would keep the possibility to resize it as long as it fits in its parent

@stof, you're rigth. The `resize` property is not supported by IE and Opera at all, so it's better to use `max-width`. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resize

@stof, @voronkovich Fixed, thanks!
