It feels so nice to use non-prehistoric PHP code! Thanks @voronkovich.

If anyone has other ideas to use PHP 5.5 features in the demo app, please share them!

Should we use:
```php
$entityManager->getRepository(User::class)
```
instead of:
```php
$entityManager->getRepository('AppBundle:User')
```
?

@voronkovich I would say yes. ``AppBundle:`` shortcuts would probably not be implemented in Doctrine if the project started today.

@stof, I agree with you. I've changed the code.
