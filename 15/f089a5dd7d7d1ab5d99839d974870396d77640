@bocharsky-bw while trying to merge I see this error ðŸ¤”

```
  Error Output:
  ================
  ERROR: Permission to bocharsky-bw/demo.git denied to javiereguiluz.
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

  Please make sure you have the correct access rights
  and the repository exists.
```

Not sure what can I do on my side.

Hm, super weird... I have "Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers" enabled for this PR... and no special security for that repo too. Probably a temporary GitHub outage? I also squashed commits here to see if helps. If no - probably easier to recreate a PR

Hi Victor ... thanks a lot for checking this. Actually, I read the error message too fast. Apparently, the issue is that I no longer have permission to push to `symfony/demo` either:

```
ERROR: Permission to symfony/demo.git denied to javiereguiluz.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

I've asked @fabpot, so hopefully we can sort this out. Thanks.
