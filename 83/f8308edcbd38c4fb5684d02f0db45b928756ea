In my apps, I usually declare all classes `final` unless I have a good reason not to. I wouldn't mind if the demo app followed this rule as well. 🙂

So 👍🏻  from my side.

The only problem I see is that the maker bundle doesn't put the final keyword on controllers.

There are [good reasons](https://matthiasnoback.nl/2018/09/final-classes-by-default-why/) to use final by default. Can we explain with a comment somewhere is this project?
