> Add at least 1 tag to every blog post, to make the design more consistent

The validation of posts does not require having at least 1 tag. So if the design does not support such case, it means that there is a bug in the code, not that fixtures should be changed

I've changed the fixtures again: posts can have 0 tags ... but the first post now always has 2 tags, to make the application look better.
