What about to create simple separate bundle (ShowSourceBundle) and move there the ControllerListener, SourceCodeExtension and related views? All this stuff is not needed for newcomers.

@voronkovich at first sight I like your idea. This could even let us show how easy can you create additional bundles in your application when needed. Please let's us think over this idea a bit more before implementing it. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz,  ok. I've created an issue about it.

@javiereguiluz this should still be merged before starting the move of classes to avoid conflicts

@stof sure! I'm going to merge it right now. Thanks a lot for providing this improvement.
