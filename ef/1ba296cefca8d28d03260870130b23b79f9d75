@javiereguiluz updating the commit message and the PR title would be a good idea.

~~@bocharsky-bw ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± I don't know what I was thinking. I'm closing this PR. Will you send a PR for 2.8.5 as you usually do? thanks!~~

Sorry for the noise!  I was using the Symfony Demo to test Symfony 3.1 (to write the blog posts, to test the Cache component, etc.)  So I made lots of changes in the composer.json file and the app and then reverted everything and I wasn't sure if I had updated to 2.8.x or 3.x.
