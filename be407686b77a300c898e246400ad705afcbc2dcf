By the way: should we add them to the English file too in case someone uses it as a reference to search for missing translations in their language?

IMO, we should have all translations in the English files, yes. this way, you can easily find missing ones

:+1: @xabbuh, but i would like to use translations keys, instead of translating the language directly.

``previous_label`` or ``label_previous``

@OskarStark We can't control that (the string to be translated comes from a third-party library).
