@bocharsky-bw thanks for this fix ... but I'm afraid I have bad news for you :cry: This project is compatible with `php >=5.3.9` so we can't use the `::class` trick and we must use the entire fully qualified class name of the form types.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For now, but when we update to the Symfony 3 we should use `5.5.9` at least, right? It will work then.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So keep it as is or update with fully qualified classname?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good question. I'd prefer to use the full string because that works perfectly on 2.8 and 3.0 ... but in the future we'll need to change it again to make code more concise.

@bocharsky-bw, you forgot to update form type's classes too. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony-demo/blob/master/src/AppBundle/Form/PostType.php

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz You're right. I updated with fully qualified classname for now.

@voronkovich Did you mean this https://github.com/symfony/symfony-demo/blob/master/src/AppBundle/Form/PostType.php#L64 ? Seems for now we should use fully qualified classnames, but thanks you pointed it!

@bocharsky-bw, ok.

You should also switch to FQCN rather than legacy type names inside the existing form types to avoid deprecation warnings there

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz this requires bumping the Symfony requirement to ``~2.8`` though. Currently, the code still says ``~2.7``

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bocharsky-bw at 2015-11-20T09:14:35Z

Switched. Thanks @stof !

This comment is not related to this PR. But IMHO these changes are a throwback for developers. :(
