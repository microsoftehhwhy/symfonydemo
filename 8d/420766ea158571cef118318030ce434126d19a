Now the tests fail because the PHP files in `app/` and `web/` don't have this header. We won't add it to those files, so how can we solve this?

Add `->notPath('web/app_dev.php')` etc to $finder in .php_cs file ? But this would exclude those files from other checks. I don't know if this is something acceptable.

Yes ... but we want the rest of the rules applied to app/ and web/ files :(

I don't think there is a way to exclude some checks for a particular path. Maybe this could be a new feature.

@javiereguiluz if we let the license be included in these files?

@yceruto let's do that because I honestly see no other solution.
