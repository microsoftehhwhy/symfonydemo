> What about to [encapsulate collections](https://refactoring.com/catalog/encapsulateCollection.html)?

The big drawback of that is that it breaks laziness of the collection in case the getter turns it into an array, which means it is not free from a performance point of view. So I would not showcase it in the demo.
