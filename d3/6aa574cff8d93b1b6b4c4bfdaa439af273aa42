Thanks for contributing these translations. I'll wait for the review of our German-speaking friends. About your question: we don't have any policy about this or use any of the tools you mentioned. Thanks!

The security check is failing on my language file changes - I love Travis :tongue:

While playing wit #531 I discovered more missing strings... @xabbuh would you mind to re-check? :wink:

Fixed, Thanks!

I also changed everything to "informal".

BTW: @xabbuh do you think #531 makes any sense? How do *you* check for missing translations? Don't you think using an online translation service (Transifex, Crowdin, etc.) would help?

Thanks again :wink:
