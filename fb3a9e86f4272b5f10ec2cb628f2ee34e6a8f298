@OskarStark There is no Symfony's logo in `Symfony Demo Application`, so I think it will be unnecessary for this PR.

P.S. I think Symfony's logo discussion could be open as a [new issue](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-demo/issues/new).

@OskarStark I think the Symfony logo should be reserved for the Symfony installation. This demo is independent from the framework, so I think we can change its design to match our styles.

yes but the name ```Symfony```is used everywhere...

@OskarStark let me put my reasoning in other words: this app is "made with Symfony" but "it's not Symfony". But let's see if other developers think we should add the logo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz i understand your reasoning, but i think this is an app which shows best practices by the symfony community with standard symfony edition... so a logo makes it more clear.... before this pr there was a symfony logo, or?

@bocharsky-bw I agree. Done. Thanks.

@OskarStark I think better to create a new issue for this discussion about Symfony's logo in order to other developers could also tell their opinion.

@javiereguiluz What about to add some instructions to `README.md` for this `check.php` usage at the beginning?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@bocharsky-bw I like the idea a lot. Done in d88ef7b

What about renaming the file to `config.php`? Then its name is consistent with the one from the Standard Edition.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bocharsky-bw at 2015-07-06T17:50:00Z

@xabbuh I think about it too, but there are no any config operations, only environment checks, so it seems to confused a bit as for me.
