I'm seeing this error when clicking on the Doctrine panel of the Debug Toolbar. The same happened in RC1 and I don't see any error in the other panels. Any clue? Should I report to main Symfony repo?

this issue is already reported in the `symfony/symfony` and `doctrine-bundle` repository:

- https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/24804
- https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/issues/73

It's supposed to be fixed in https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/735

but it's not part of the 1.8 release yet.
