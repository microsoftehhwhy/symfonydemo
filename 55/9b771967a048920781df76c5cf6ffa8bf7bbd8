This way selected tag is highlighted:

Is this something we want to improve? or does this seem irrelevant for demo purpose?

This feature:

- looks great;
- requires so little changes in the codebase;
- shows the use case for the Doctrine's operator `MEMBER OF`.

IMHO, this PR should be merged.

Sorry I didn't merge this on time. I like it too. A ver minor comment: should we use `label-success` instead of `label-warning` to highlight the selected tag? This is how `label-success` would look:

Rebased and `label-success` applied.
