Somehow this is working here https://github.com/symfony/symfony-demo/pull/580 without doing it public :/

@yceruto : Sure it's working (I did that first, but then remembered we default to private services...so, was weird). As shown in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-demo/pull/580#issuecomment-306258476, this is because sf 3.3 still support getting private services, but we should avoid relying on this as it's now deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.

However, I missed your PR, sorry ðŸ˜•
