Hm, still does not work, probably the problem is in something else, depends on how that "hash" is generated, because when I manually change the full path to the repo locally - it still works for me. Closing it

@bocharsky-bw would this be fixed (or would it simplify the solution) if we disable versioning? I think we can do that for this demo app.

Hm, if we could consider disabling versioning on this app - I think it might help then. Let's figure it out

OK, this looks like a working example based on TravisCI
