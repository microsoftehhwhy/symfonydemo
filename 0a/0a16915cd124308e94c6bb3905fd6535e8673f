The badge is still on the same line though

@stof I meant here that Heroku button is on line 7 and Travis badge is on line 8 in a source code. Do you think we should place them both on the separate lines in rendered view too?

@bocharsky-bw, what about to move this button to the "installation" section?

Move Heroku deploy button to the Installation section is a good idea, I think.

I agree with @voronkovich: let's move Heroku button to Install section.
