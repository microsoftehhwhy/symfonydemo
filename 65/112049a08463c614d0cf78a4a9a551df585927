It would be interesting to review this PR after being updated to Symfony 6.2.

We've merged the PR that upgrades to 6.2. If you can, please rebase this PR. Thanks!

At the moment weâ€™ve got 1 error:
```
require.doctrine/doctrine-bundle : exact version constraints (2.7.x-dev) should be avoided if the package follows semantic versioning
```

The `doctrine/doctrine-bundle` package has been bumped to `2.7.x-dev` in 1c9ca01. Could we use another version?

That is fixed by https://github.com/symfony/demo/pull/1372
