Thanks for the report :wink: I actually think I found the problem which lies inside `dama/doctrine-test-bundle`.

I will look into this tomorrow and will let you know asap.

@voronkovich there is a new release that fixes the problem :wink:

https://github.com/dmaicher/doctrine-test-bundle/releases/tag/v1.0.12

So if you run `composer update dama/doctrine-test-bundle` and commit the changes the build should pass.
