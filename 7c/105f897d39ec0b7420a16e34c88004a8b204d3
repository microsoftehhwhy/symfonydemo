Thinking about this ... what if we make it a real dependency, instead of a "dev" dependency? MakerBundle is great and having installed in Symfony Demo would be a great way to showcase it.

Hm, but what's the point of using it in prod? I just don't want to make devs think that it's a good idea to use MakerBundle in prod environment
