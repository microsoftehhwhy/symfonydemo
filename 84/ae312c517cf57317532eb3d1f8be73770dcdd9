There's nothing to fix here. That PhpStorm inspection is pointless and disabling it gives me peace of mind in every codebase I've worked on so far. 😌

Yes, but it's mainly for consistency to avoid having different orders everywhere. It should/could be a php-cs-fixer rule.

Is there a reason we don't use php-cs-fixer in this project?

You are right from a technical POV @derrabus, but I would argue that most of the devs write it in the from @COil proposed order anyway. That said I am +1 to merge this change.

This repo ist mostly for newcomers 🤷🏼‍♂️
